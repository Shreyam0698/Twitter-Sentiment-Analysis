Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains a Twitter Sentiment Analysis project that detects positive and negative sentiments in tweets using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project is designed to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets, making it useful for social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

Features:
Sentiment Detection: Classifies tweets as positive or negative using a trained machine learning model.
Data Analysis: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Twitter dataset to gain insights into the data distribution and patterns.
NLP Techniques: Utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a supervised learning model to predict the sentiment of tweets.
Streamlit Deployment: The application is deployed using Streamlit, allowing for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreyam0698/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
bash
streamlit run app.py

Usage:
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the Streamlit app.
Upload a CSV file containing tweets or input text manually.
Click on the "Analyze" button to view the sentiment analysis results.

Project Structure:
app.py: The main file for running the Streamlit application.
model.py: Contains the machine learning model and related functions.
data/: Directory containing sample datasets.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

Data:
The dataset used for this project contains tweets with labeled sentiments (positive/negative). You can replace the sample dataset with your own data to perform sentiment analysis on different sets of tweets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the distribution of sentiments, common words in positive and negative tweets, and other insights. Visualizations were created using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to help understand the data better.

Machine Learning Model:
A machine learning model was trained using labeled data to classify tweets as positive or negative. The model was evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure its effectiveness in sentiment detection.

Streamlit Deployment:
The project is deployed using Streamlit, which provides a simple and interactive interface for users to analyze sentiments. Streamlit allows users to upload their own datasets, view analysis results, and interact with visualizations.
